# Grids
A typesetting tool for creating functional page grids with accurately sized type. 

Based on Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann's [ðŸ“™ *Grid systems in graphic design*](https://www.niggli.ch/en/produkt/grid-systems-in-graphic-design/).

## Why
Creating pixel perfect typeset grids is not hard, but it is inaccessible because [text is not the size it says it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zg3NnqWz9U). You have to do a manual process of measuring letterforms directly to calcualate the correct type size and line spacing to match your grid.

ðŸ¤” hold on, calculate?... isn't that, like, what computers are good at??

Precisely!

## What
A local electron app that takes your grid specifications and choice of typeface, crunches the numbers, and returns a preview of your type grid and the exact layout and type parameters to input in your design software (InDesign, Affinity, Figma, etc.)
